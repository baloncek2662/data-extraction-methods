# Data Extraction Methods

An automatic runner of data extraction methods RoadRunner and Webstemmer, as well as. Works on news articles. Once your environment is set up, you may run both methods at once by running the executable Python script:

```
$ ./main.py
```

`main.py` runs four functions:
1. `scrape()`, which downloads the HTML from desired webpages into `./examples/` and creates a zip of them for Webstemmer to use. At the moment this function is commented out, as we want the corpus to stay constant. The `scraped-folders` folder, which is synced with the the FOLDER_NAMES constant in `constants.py` is available for download at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1podWDM7qokj7Wn7-hS-yAPpOVX5nl6_3/view?usp=sharing 
2. `roadrunner()`, which executes the <cite>[RoadRunner][1]</cite> method and saves results and generated wrappers (in the form of `*.html` and `.*xml` files) into `./roadrunner/output/`
3. `webstemmer()`, which executes the <cite>[Webstemmer][2]</cite> method and saves results (in the form of `*.txt` files) and generated wrappers (in the form of `*.pat` files) into `./webstemmer/webstemmer/` 
4. `scrapy()`, which executes a custom implementation of <cite>[Scrapy][4]</cite>, a web crawler that extracts data using XPath, and writes the results into `*.json` files in `./scrapynews/scraped-content/`

In the end the information of time needed per webpage for each data extraction method is shown.


### Environment Setup

- Add URLs to `constants.py` to choose custom webpages from which data will be extracted
- Create a new file `.env` in the same folder as `main.py` and add the absoulte path of the folder in which you wish to save scraped data to the SCRAPE_DEST_FOLDER environment variable, eg. ` 
SCRAPE_DEST_FOLDER="/home/scraped-folders/"`
- Initialize <cite>[pipenv][3]</cite> by running `pipenv install` 
- Open pipenv shell by running `pipenv shell`
- Run the program by running `./main.py` from the repository's root folder
